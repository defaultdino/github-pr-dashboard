# Introduction

This is a neat GitHub PR Dashboard that is easy to use and looks great. Just put in the name of your organization in the settings together with a GitHub token that has `read` and `read:org` permissions, and it will work out of the box.

# Functionality

The dashboard can be viewed in either a grid view or a list view, you can toggle between light and dark mode, and filter out any repos in your organization that you are not interested in seeing the status of PR's. The dashboard will also show PR's marked as stale (older than 7 days) and also show draft PR's in a visibly different manner.
